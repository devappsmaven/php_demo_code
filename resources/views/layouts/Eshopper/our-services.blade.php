        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>What is Screen Printing?</b></h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Screen printing is a printing method where a desired image/design is achieved by pushing ink using a squeegee directly onto the garment with an ink blocking stencil supported by a woven mesh screen. One color is used per screen and it is printed one color at a time. Multiple screens are needed for a full color image/design. Screen printing is very versatile.  It can printed on a lot of different type of materials.  It is ideal for solid color designs.  However, a full color image/design can also be achieved as well.  The ink in screen printing is applied thicker than digital print, therefore the print result is very bright and opaque, even on dark garments.</p>
    
        <p>Screen printing is also commonly known as silk printing or silkscreen printing.</p>
        <p>Screen Printing is great for bulk orders.  </p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>What is Digital Printing?</b></h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Digital printing is a method of printing where an image/design is printed directly from a digital image onto the garment. Digital printing is a newer printing technique where high amounts of detail can be achieved where the result is more like a photographic print.  The greatest difference between digital printing and screen printing is that there is no screen needed in digital printing.  Because it doesn’t require screens nor physical set-up we can take orders in small quantities as little as one shirt.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>What is Embroidery?</b></h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Embroidery has been around for a very long time.  It's an ancient craft of decorating fabric or other materials using a needle to apply thread or yarn. Instead of being sewn by someone by hand, today it is done by a machine.  Embroidery is great to add a company logo to business shirts, jackets, polos or hats.  Monograms on towels, bags and robes are also very popular.  Our embroidery department can personalize on a wide variety of garments and fabrics.  There is no minimum when placing an embroidery order with us.  Whether you are looking to embroidery your name on one shirt or personalize a bulk order individually we can most certainly assist you with your order! <br></p>

        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>Screen Printing vs Digital Printing</b></h4>
        <p>What is the difference between screen printing and digital printing?  The biggest difference between screen printing and digital printing is that screen printing is a printing technique that uses one screen at a time to print each color, multiple screens are needed to achieve a full color design, whereas digital printing is printed using a computer and the design is printed directly onto the garment.  Digital printing is also known as direct to garment printing, DTG.  Both techniques are widely used.  Screen printing is usually used for printing solid ink color designs and bulk quantities.  Digital printing is more commonly used for smaller orders and orders that have high detailed designs.  </p>
    
        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>Which printing technique will be used on my order?</b></h4>
        <p>When you place an order with us, our team of expects will determine which printing method would best be used based on the artwork, garment type, number of ink colors and quantity of items ordered.  Each artwork is reviewed thoroughly to ensure the best printing quality.  We stand behind all our printing techniques, whether it's screen printing or digital printing the order will meet your satisfaction! Dye sublimation is a printing service that is not currently offered on our website.  For sublimation prints please contact our customer service and a representative will be able to assist you. <a href="contact">Contact a Representative</a>
